The GLM relaxes these assumptions and allows for various types of dependent variables, including continuous, binary, count, and categorical outcomes.\n",

    "The interpretation of coefficients in an SVM model depends on the type of SVM being used. In a linear SVM, the coefficients represent the weights assigned to features in the input space, indicating their importance in determining the decision boundary. Positive or negative signs indicate the direction of influence. In a non-linear SVM with a kernel function, interpreting coefficients directly is more complex. Instead, the relevance of features is assessed through the support vectors, which are critical data points near the decision boundary. Coefficients alone may not provide a direct interpretation, and understanding the collective impact of features and support vectors is crucial. Further analysis and domain knowledge may be needed for comprehensive interpretation."

    "A decision tree is a predictive algorithm that uses a flowchart-like structure to make predictions. It selects the most informative feature to split the data based on a splitting criterion, creating a hierarchical structure of internal nodes and branches. This process is repeated recursively until a stopping criterion is met, and leaf nodes are assigned predicted outcomes or values. To make predictions, new data follows the decision path to reach the appropriate leaf node, and the associated prediction is assigned. Decision trees are interpretable, handle both categorical and numerical data, and can capture complex relationships. Overfitting can be mitigated through techniques like pruning or ensemble methods."
